## Flowcharts

### Flowchart

Flowcharts are graphical representations of processes, depicting the steps and decision points involved in executing an algorithm or solving a problem. Different shapes represent different elements:

1. **Start/Stop**: Oval shape or circle.
2. **Input/Output**: Parallelogram.
3. **Processing**: Rectangle.
4. **Condition**: Rhombus.

The flow direction of the program is indicated by arrows connecting the shapes.

### Example Flowchart:

Consider the following scenario:

Explanation:
- **Start**: The process begins here.
- **Input**: The user inputs the salary.
- **Decision**: The program checks if the salary is greater than 10,000.
- **Processing**: Depending on the condition, the program adds a bonus.
- **Output**: The final result is output.

## What are Flowcharts?

Flowcharts are used to visualize our thought process and algorithms. They provide a clear and structured representation of the steps involved in solving a problem or executing a program.

### Example:

Consider the following scenario:
```
Take input of a salary.
If the salary is greater than 10,000, add a bonus of 2000; otherwise, add a bonus of 1000.
```

This can be represented as a flowchart:

Explanation:
- The process begins with taking input.
- A decision is made based on the salary value.
- Processing occurs accordingly, adding the bonus.
- The final result is output.

## What is Pseudocode?

Pseudocode is a high-level description of a computer program or algorithm, using plain English or a mixture of English and informal programming language syntax. It serves as a rough sketch of the code logic before actual implementation.

### Example:

Consider the following pseudocode:
```
Take input of salary
If salary is greater than 10,000
Add bonus as 2000
Else
Add bonus as 1000
```

Pseudocode allows programmers to outline the logic of their code in a clear and readable manner before translating it into a specific programming language.
