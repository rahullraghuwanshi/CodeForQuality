## Question 1 : How to choose between apply and with?



In Kotlin, both `apply` and `with` are standard library functions used to configure objects and execute code blocks. They are similar in some respects but serve different purposes and have different use cases. Choosing between them depends on the specific context and what you want to achieve.

### `apply`

The `apply` function is used to configure an object. It runs a block of code on the object and returns the object itself. It's typically used for object initialization and configuration.

#### Characteristics of `apply`:

- **Receiver Object**: The block of code runs with the object (`this`) as its receiver.
- **Returns the Object**: It returns the object itself, allowing for chaining.
- **Common Use Case**: Initialization and configuration of an object.

#### Example of `apply`:

```kotlin
data class Person(var name: String, var age: Int, var city: String)

fun main() {
    val person = Person("Alice", 30, "New York").apply {
        name = "Bob"
        age = 25
        city = "San Francisco"
    }
    println(person)
}
```

In this example, `apply` is used to modify the properties of the `Person` object and then return the modified object.

### `with`

The `with` function is used to run a block of code on an object and return the result of the block. It is typically used when you want to operate on an object without needing to return the object itself.

#### Characteristics of `with`:

- **Receiver Object**: The block of code runs with the object (`this`) as its receiver.
- **Returns the Result**: It returns the result of the block.
- **Common Use Case**: Performing multiple operations on an object and returning a result.

#### Example of `with`:

```kotlin
data class Person(var name: String, var age: Int, var city: String)

fun main() {
    val person = Person("Alice", 30, "New York")
    val result = with(person) {
        println("Name: $name")
        println("Age: $age")
        println("City: $city")
        "This is the result"
    }
    println(result)
}
```

In this example, `with` is used to print the properties of the `Person` object and return a string result.

### When to Use `apply`

- **Initialization and Configuration**: When you need to initialize or configure an object and want to return the object itself.
- **Chaining Calls**: When you want to chain multiple calls on the same object.

#### Example:

```kotlin
val person = Person("Alice", 30, "New York").apply {
    name = "Bob"
    age = 25
    city = "San Francisco"
}.apply {
    println(this)
}
```

### When to Use `with`

- **Non-Returning Operations**: When you want to perform operations on an object and do not need to return the object itself.
- **Returning a Result**: When you want to perform operations on an object and return the result of those operations.

#### Example:

```kotlin
val description = with(person) {
    "Name: $name, Age: $age, City: $city"
}
println(description)
```

### Summary

- **`apply`**: Use when you want to configure an object and return the object itself. It is useful for setting properties and chaining operations on the same object.
- **`with`**: Use when you want to perform operations on an object and return the result of those operations. It is useful when the focus is on the result of the block rather than the object itself.

Choosing between `apply` and `with` depends on whether you need to return the object you're operating on or the result of the operations performed within the block. Use `apply` for configuring objects and `with` for operations where the result is more important than the object.
